#  GeKoS Graphics

A simple implementation of the Graphical Kernel System as described in the textbook "blah blah". This program is a learning tool for how 3D graphics work. Trying to keep it as simple and fun to code as possible.

## Goal of this project:
- Learn 3D graphics concepts and build a reusable library in C.
- Create a UI application using the library to produce 3D images.
- Ultimately, try to re-create all of the images from the textbook.
